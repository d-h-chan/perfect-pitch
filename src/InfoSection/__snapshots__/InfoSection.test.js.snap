    What is perfect pitch?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Absolute pitch (AP), often called perfect pitch, is the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given musical note without the benefit of a reference tone. Applications of perfect pitch include: naming individul pitches (e.g. Fâ™¯, A, G, C) played on various instruments, naming the key of a given piece of tonal music, identifying and naming all the tones of a given chord or other tonal mass, or accurately singing a named pitch.
